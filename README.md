Zombieparent is an activity tracker under development.  The goal is to give sleep-deprived parents and caregivers an easy way to log child care events, discover and view patterns, and establish rhythms with their child.  The app will be built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.  

This project is currently in *~hopes and dreams~* status.
